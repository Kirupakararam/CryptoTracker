# CryptoTracker
🎯 Objective:
Build a responsive React + Redux Toolkit app that tracks real-time crypto prices (like CoinMarketCap), simulating WebSocket updates and managing all state via Redux.

🛠️ Tech Reqs
📊 UI Table:
- Display 5 assets (e.g., BTC, ETH, USDT) in a table:
  
   Logo | Name | Symbol | Price | 1h % | 24h % | 7d % | Market Cap | 24h Volume | Circulating Supply | Max Supply | 7D Chart
- Use sample crypto data.
- Color-code % changes: green (positive), red (negative).
- 7D chart can be static (SVG/image).
- Make table responsive.
